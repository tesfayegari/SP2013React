# SP2013React

- This is a very little thing to setup React in SharePoint 2013
- I have used Bootstrap for a little branding of displaying lists in Cards. But you can ignore that
- I have used jQuery to fetch data from SharePoint using REST API

I hope this is a good start to setup and work using REACT and SharePoint 2013 Classic mode. I am using babbel browser but if you can use webpack that would be great
